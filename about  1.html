 <h1>Origins</h1>
25 year old Shamoon Sultan opened the first Khaadi store in Karachi, Pakistan. The idea for a store like Khaadi was conceived in the mind of this pioneering, pure patriot, nostalgic about the old craft of the hand woven material. Khaadi was originally a men’s clothing brand selling basic-colored kurtas. Khaadi immediately questioned the status quo and made a bold statement. Saira Shamoon, brought in her expertise and splashed a vibrant colour palette on every piece, making a simple men’s Kurta an unapologetic fashion statement.

  <li>Ever changing, evolving, expanding, by 2002 it was making women’s wear and soon expanded into women’s luxury wear with Khaadi Khaas launching in 2008. It was 2012 that saw Khaadi change to a mega retail brand, as it decided to evolve with the customer and introduce colourful lawn prints. This time not for a niche market but for the wide variety of Pakistanis customers.
  
  Forever innovative and experimental, Khaadi introduced furniture, bedsheets, bags, accessories, shoes and soon became a complete lifestyle brand. In just 2 decades, Shamoon Sultan’s 400sqft store transformed into a 60-store enterprise stretching over 30 cities across Pakistan and 13 stores internationally in UK, UAE, Qatar and Bahrain, making its mark on-ground and online.

    <li>Our new logo is reflective of our CEO, Shamoon Sultan’s vision of growth and expansion. It is to position Khaadi as the leading brand in Pakistan with a global footprint. Two decades ago, we started off by catering to a different customer, now our customer has a new mind set and we need to be relevant. There’s a new generation of clientele that is looking towards our brand and they are more confident, expressive, and empowered in the way they are thinking. The craftsman’s hand is still an inherent part of Khaadi. The two hands which symbolized our heritage in handloom craft have now been merged and connected with the brand logo. Their expression has transformed to reflect Khaadi’s next journey.
